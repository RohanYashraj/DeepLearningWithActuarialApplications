# Deep Learning with Actuarial Applications in R
Material for the 2-day block course "Deep Learning with Actuarial Applications in R" of the [Swiss Association of Actuaries](www.actuaries.ch).

### Prerequisites:
- Good knowledge of insurance risk modelling
- Experience in basic R programming, i.e. familiar with tidyverse, ggplot2 and base package (Hint: you should already know how to fit a glm in R)
- Participants need to bring their own laptop. It is an advantage to have R/RStudio installed lo-cally, but not required to do the exercises.

### Topics:
- Topic 1: Recap: Generalized Linear Models
- Topic 2: Feedforward Neural Networks
- Topic 3: Discrimination-Free Insurance Pricing
- Topic 4: LocalGLMnet
- Topic 5: Convolutional Neural Networks
